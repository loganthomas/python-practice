Problem 1: Overlapping Rectangles
---------------------------------

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2],
where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2)
is the coordinate of its top-right corner.

Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and
right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.
To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges
DO NOT overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they
overlap, otherwise return false.


Example 1:
----------
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
----------
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false

Example 3:
----------
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]
Output: false
