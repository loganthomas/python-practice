"""
Quick Sort
-----------
Pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers
that are less than the partitioning element come before all elements
that are greater than it. The partitioning can be performed efficiently
through a series of swaps.

If we repeatedly partition the array (and its sub-arrays) around an
element, the array will eventually become sorted. However, as the
partitioned element is not guaranteed to be the median (or anywhere
near the median), our sorting could be very slow. This is the reason
for O(n**2) worst case runtime

Runtime: O(n*log(n)) average O(n**2) worst case
Memory: O(log(n))
